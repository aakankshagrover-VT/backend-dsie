Uniform Interface --> Clearly defined API endpoints with clearly defined request + response data structure
Stateless Interactions --> Server and client don't store any connection history, every request is handled seperately 

Cacheable --> Servers may set caching headers to allow the client to cache responses
Client-Server --> Server and client are separated, client is not concerned with persistent data storage
Layered-system --> Server may forward request to other APIs
Code on Demand --> Executable code may be transferred from server to client
